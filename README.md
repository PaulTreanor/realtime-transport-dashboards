Serverless APIs for AWS to build and display Irish public transportation real time data.

This is a sample serverless application that can be used for workshops or other educational purposes.


The application allows you to create **dashboards**. Every dashboard can contain 0 or more **widgets**. A widget can display real time information about a specific Dublin Bus stop, a LUAS stop or a Irish Rail station.

The application offers [APIs](#apis) to create, edit and visualize dashboards and widgets.


## Getting started

Before starting make sure you have the [AWS CLI installed](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and properly [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).

You will also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 8+.

Now clone this repository in your local workspace and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now you can deploy the service to your local AWS account with the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

If everything went fine you should see the URL for the deployed API endpoints.


## APIs

Once you deploy the functions you will be able to access the following APIS:

 - [createDashboard](#createdashboard): creates a new dashboard
 - [updateDashboard](#updatedashboard): updates an existing dashboard
 - [deleteDashboard](#deletedashboard): deletes an existing dashboard
 - [getDashboard](#getdashboard): get data for a dashboard
