Serverless APIs for AWS to build and display Irish public transportation real time data.

This is a sample serverless application that can be used for workshops or other educational purposes.

## Getting started

Before starting make sure you have the [AWS CLI installed](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and properly [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).

You will also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 8+.

Now clone this repository in your local workspace and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now you can deploy the service to your local AWS account with the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

If everything went fine you should see the URL for the deployed API endpoints.


## APIs

 - POST `/dashboard`: create a new dashboard
 - GET `/dashboard/{dashboard_id}`: get data for a dashboard
 - POST `/dashboard/{dashboard_id}/widget`: add a new widget
 - POST `/dashboard/{dashboard_id}/widget/{widget_id}`: edit a widget
 - DELETE `/dashboard/{dashboard_id}/widget/{widget_id}`: delete a widget
